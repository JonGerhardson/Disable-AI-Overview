Currently unsigned firefox add on to append udm=14 to google search queries, which disables the AI overview pane from displaying in search results. To run you need to first clone this repository and then open about:debugging in firefox, and load it as a temporary exetension by opening manifest.json. This took 10 minutes to vibe code and I don't presently have a firefox developer account to get the extension signed, which is required in order to permantly install it. Extension needs to be reloaded every time firefox is restarted for the time being. MIT lisence so if you want to do that part yourself go nuts. AI overviews can be toggled on or off by pinning the extension to toolbar, and clicking the icon to toggle on/off.
